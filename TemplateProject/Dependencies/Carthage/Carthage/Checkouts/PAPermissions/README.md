## Installation


### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects.

To integrate PAPermissions into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'PAPermissions'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Carthage

Add this to Cartfile
```sh
github "ReactiveX/RxSwift" "3.0.0-beta.1"
```

```sh
$ carthage update
```

### Manual Installation

Just copy the PAPermissions folder in your project

## Run the Example

## How it works

Create a new UIViewController, inherit from *PAPermissionsViewController* and write:

```
	let microphoneCheck = PAMicrophonePermissionsCheck()
	let cameraCheck = PACameraPermissionsCheck()

	override func viewDidLoad() {
		super.viewDidLoad()

		//Custom settings
		self.locationCheck.requestAlwaysAuthorization = true


		let permissions = [
	          PAPermissionsItem.itemForType(.microphone, reason: "Required to hear your beautiful voice")!,
					  PAPermissionsItem.itemForType(.camera, reason: "Required to shoot awesome photos")!]

		let handlers = [
						PAPermissionsType.microphone.rawValue: self.microphoneCheck,
						PAPermissionsType.camera.rawValue: self.cameraCheck]
		self.setupData(permissions, handlers: handlers)

		self.titleText = "My Awesome App"
		self.detailsText = "Please enable the following"
	}

```

That's it!

Anyway you no need to import everything, just remove the unnecessary "check" classes and keep the ones you want to use, you will find them in "Checks" folder.
